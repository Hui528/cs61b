#Project 2 Description
Based on Google Maps clone and two useful data structure,
built a web mapping application 
for a small piece of the real world map.

- Built an AI for finding the shortest route between two locations, autocomplete search, and presenting goal's locations like Google Map (Project 2d)
- Combined Dijkstra's and A* algorithm for finding the shortest path (Project 2c)
- Built two data structure called Extrinsic Priority Queue and KdTree (Project 2ab)

##AI features:
Routing (finding the shortest route between two points):
